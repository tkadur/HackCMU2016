# HackCMU2016

FaceIt! is our final product for the CMU Hackathon 2016. The 4 team members who contributed to this project were all participating in a hackathon for the first time.

The 24 hour period in which we coded are not reflective of our full coding ability and instead demonstrate our ability to collaborate as a team and develop a functioning software for a final demonstration purpose.

Run Webcam-Face-Detect-Testing/webcam_cv3.py to see our project in action.
