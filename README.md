# HackCMU2016

FaceIt! is our final product for the CMU Hackathon 2016. The 4 team members who contributed to this project were all participating in a hackathon for the first time.

Due to the 24 hour period in which we worked and our inexperience with hackathons, we believe this code is not representative of the programming skill of any of the members involved. It instead demonstrates our ability to collaborate as a team under time constraints and develop software for a final demonstration purpose while working with OpenCV for the first time.

Run Webcam-Face-Detect-Testing/webcam_cv3.py to see our project in action.
